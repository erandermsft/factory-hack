# Challenge 3: Maintenance Scheduler & Parts Ordering Agents

Welcome to Challenge 3!

In this challenge, you'll work with two specialized AI agents that optimize factory operations through intelligent maintenance scheduling and automated supply chain management.

**Expected Duration:** 60 minutes
**Prerequisites**: [Challenge 0](../challenge-0/challenge-0.md) successfully completed

## 🎯 Objective

The goals for this challenge are:

- Create two Foundry agents using Python
- Use Agent memory
- Examine Agent observability


## 🧭 Context and background information

![Challenge 3 scenario](./images/challenge-3-scenario.png)

The **Maintenance Scheduler Agent** analyzes work orders and historical maintenance data to find optimal maintenance windows that minimize production disruption.
The **Parts Ordering Agent** checks inventory levels for required parts, evaluates supplier performance and lead times, and generates optimized parts orders with cost analysis.

You will use the Azure resources highlighted in the image below.

### Azure AI Tracing & Observability

Both agents are instrumented for **end-to-end observability** so you can debug runs and understand model behavior without adding print statements everywhere.

What you get in traces:

- **Agent execution timeline**: each step (read data, reason, write results)
- **AI model calls**: prompts, responses, token usage, and latency (when enabled)
- **Cosmos DB operations**: reads/writes to containers used by the agents
- **Failures with context**: exceptions + which step failed

How tracing is enabled:

Tracing is designed to be **automatic when configured**: if the tracing dependencies are present and an Application Insights connection string is available, the agents will emit rich traces covering both the workflow steps and model calls.

## ✅ Tasks

### Task 1: Maintenance Scheduler Agent

The Maintenance Scheduler Agent analyzes work orders and determines the optimal time to perform maintenance by balancing equipment reliability needs against production impact.

What it does

1. **Reads Work Order** from `WorkOrders` container
2. **Analyzes Historical Data** from `MaintenanceHistory` container to understand failure patterns
3. **Checks Available Windows** from `MaintenanceWindows` container to find low-impact periods
4. **Runs AI Analysis** using Microsoft Agent Framework to assess risk and recommend timing
5. **Saves Schedule** to `MaintenanceSchedules` container with risk scores and recommendations
6. **Updates Work Order** status to 'Scheduled'

---

#### Task 1.1 Run the Agent

```bash
cd /workspaces/factory-hack/challenge-3
python agents/maintenance_scheduler_agent.py wo-2024-456
```

---

#### Task 1.2 Review the output

Window: 22:00 - 06:00
Production Impact: Low
Risk Score: 85/100
Failure Probability: 70.0%
Recommended Action: URGENT

Reasoning:
Given the high priority work order and historical pattern of temperature sensor 
failures on machine-001, immediate scheduling is recommended. The selected 
weekend night window (Saturday 10PM - Sunday 6AM) minimizes production impact 
while addressing the critical temperature sensor issue before potential failure.

> [!TIP]
> See the AI Tracing and Observability background overview in the [Context and background](#azure-ai-tracing--observability) section

#### Task 3.1: Generate traces

- Run either agent normally (Tasks 1 and 2).
- To generate multiple traces quickly:

```bash
python run-batch.py
```

#### Task 3.2: View traces in Azure AI Foundry

1. Go to <https://ai.azure.com>
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Tracing** (often under **Build**)
4. Filter by agent name (e.g., `MaintenanceSchedulerAgent`, `PartsOrderingAgent`) and time range

## 🧠 Conclusion and reflection

🎉 Congratulations! You've successfully worked with two agents that integrate with Cosmos DB and include production-ready observability.

Let’s quickly recap what we did.

In [Task 1](#task-1-maintenance-scheduler-agent) we created the **Maintenance Scheduler Agent** to analyze work orders, look at historical maintenance patterns, find low-impact maintenance windows, and then save a schedule back to Cosmos DB.

![Task 1](./images/challenge-3-task-1.png)

In [Task 2](#task-2-run-parts-ordering-agent) we created the **Parts Ordering Agent** to check required parts, validate what’s already in inventory, select an optimized supplier plan, and write a parts order back to Cosmos DB.

![Task 2](./images/challenge-3-task-2.png)

Finally, in [Task 3](#task-3-azure-ai-tracing--observability) we used **Azure AI Foundry tracing** to observe the end-to-end workflow, including data access and model calls.

![Task 3](./images/challenge-3-task-3.png)

You've learned how to:

- **Read from Cosmos DB** - Query work orders, history, inventory, and supplier data
- **Write to Cosmos DB** - Save generated schedules and parts orders
- **Update existing records** - Change work order status based on agent actions
- **Use Microsoft Agent Framework** - Modern agent architecture with `ChatAgent`
- **Integrate with Azure AI Foundry** - Run agents with integrated tracing
- **Build data-driven agents** - Combine database queries with AI analysis
- **Handle multiple containers** - Work with complex data relationships
- **Implement tracing & observability** - Monitor agent performance and model usage
